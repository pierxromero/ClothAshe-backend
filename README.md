# ClothAshe-backend â€“ Service Layer Implementation
Added service and service implementation layers for 14 entities, excluding AdminEntity, AuthInfoEntity, and PaymentEntity due to pending security considerations. For now, all services implement basic CRUD operations.
Reminder: Duplicate checks must be added to the create methods in the service implementations.
