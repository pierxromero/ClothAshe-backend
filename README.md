# Add DTOs for all core entities to support API data transfer and validation
Implemented Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) for entities including User, Product, Order, Cart, Payment, and others. Each DTO includes field-level validation annotations to ensure robust request handling and clean separation from persistence models. This lays the groundwork for a secure and maintainable REST API layer.
